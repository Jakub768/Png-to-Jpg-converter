# Png-to-Jpg-converter
A simple tkinker python program to convert PNG images to Jpeg format. 
This is simply to check if I can do it and also to ease my workflow and perhaps add it to my portfolio of "attempting" learning coding and for career.

I am planning to add more features such as:
- be able to convert more than 1 JPG file
- Improve UI
- Cleanup code
